PEDAC:

1. Understand the problem
- if there's an immediate threat, our algorithm right now is dumb and doesn't try to protect itself. We'd like to smarten it up a bit.
- Inputs: the current board and all of its human & computer markers. It needs to know where there are two human markers with an adjacent empty space.
- Outputs: the locations of any immediate threat(s)

Questions: what happens if there are more than one immediate threats? Assume that we choose randomly

2. Examples
- ... pretty straightforward

3. Data structure
- 

4. Algorithm

5. Code
